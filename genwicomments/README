1.) Untar this into your plugins directory (you've probably already done this)

2.) Go to your options menu and add your Flickr API key and username, and your
    del.icio.us username and password.

3.) Add the following line to your index.php template:
        <?php include ABSPATH . '/wp-content/plugins/recent/index.php'; ?>

    NOTE: This needs to be placed pretty much right after the while loop that
    loops through your posts. The lines above mine look something like this:

    <?php if (have_posts()) : ?>
        
        <?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
